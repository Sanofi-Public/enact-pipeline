# ENACT: End-to-End Analysis and Cell Type Annotation for Visium High Definition (HD) Slides

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables the study of gene expression within its spatial context in histopathology samples. To date, a limiting factor has been the resolution of sequencing based ST products. The introduction of the Visium High Definition (HD) technology opens the door to cell resolution ST studies. However, challenges remain in the ability to accurately map transcripts to cells and in cell type assignment based on spot data.

ENACT is the first tissue-agnostic pipeline that integrates advanced cell segmentation with Visium HD transcriptomics data to infer cell types across whole tissue sections. Our pipeline incorporates novel bin-to-cell assignment methods, enhancing the accuracy of single-cell transcript estimates. Validated on diverse synthetic and real datasets, our approach demonstrates high effectiveness at predicting cell types and scalability, offering a robust solution for spatially resolved transcriptomics analysis.

This repository has the code for inferring cell types from the sub-cellular transcript counts provided by VisiumHD.

This can be achieved through the following steps:

1. **Cell segmentation**: segment high resolution image using NN-based image segmentation networks such as Stardist.
2. **Bin-to-cell assignment**: Obtain cell-wise transcript counts by aggregating the VisiumHD bins that are associated with each cell
3. **Cell type inference**: Use the cell-wise transcript counts to infer the cell labels/ phenotypes using methods used for single-cell RNA seq analysis ([CellAsign](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0529-1#:~:text=CellAssign%20uses%20a%20probabilistic%20model%20to%20assign%20single) or [CellTypist](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35549406/#:~:text=To%20systematically%20resolve%20immune%20cell%20heterogeneity%20across%20tissues,) or [Sargent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016123001966#:~:text=We%20present%20Sargent,%20a%20transformation-free,%20cluster-free,%20single-cell%20annotation) if installed) or novel approaches, and use comprehensive cell marker databases ([Panglao](https://panglaodb.se/index.html) or [CellMarker](http://xteam.xbio.top/CellMarker/) can be used as reference).

## System Requirements
ENACT was tested with the following specifications:
* Hardware Requirements: 32 CPU, 64GB RAM, 100 GB (harddisk and memory requirements may vary depending on whole slide image size; if the weight of the wsi is small the memory requirements can be significantly decreased)

* Software: Python 3.9, (Optional) GPU (CUDA 11)

## Install ENACT from Source 
### Step 1: Clone ENACT repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Sanofi-OneAI/oneai-dda-spatialtr-enact.git
cd oneai-dda-spatialtr-enact
```
### Step 2: Setup Python environment
Start by defining the location and the name of the Conda environment in the `Makefile`:
```
ENV_DIR := /home/oneai/envs/   <---- Conda environment location
PY_ENV_NAME := enact_py_env    <---- Conda environment name
```
Next, run the following Make command to create a Conda environment with all of ENACT's dependencies
```
make setup_py_env
```

## Install ENACT with Pip
ENACT can be installed from [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/enact-SO/) using:
```
pip install enact-SO
```

## Input Files for ENACT
ENACT requires only three files, which can be obtained from SpaceRanger’s outputs for each experiment:

1. **Whole resolution tissue image**. This will be segmented to obtain the cell boundaries that will be used to aggregate the transcript counts.
2. **tissue_positions.parquet**. This is the file that specifies the *2um* Visium HD bin locations relative to the full resolution image.
3. **filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5**. This is the .h5 file with the *2um* Visium HD bin counts.

## Defining ENACT Configurations
All of ENACT's configurations are specified in the `config/configs.yaml`:

## Output Files for ENACT
ENACT outputs all its results under the `cache` directory which gets automatically created at run time:
```
.
└── cache/
    └── <anaylsis_name> /
        ├── chunks/
        │   ├── bins_gdf/
        │   │   └── patch_<patch_id>.csv

ENACT breaks down the whole resolution image into "chunks" (or patches) of size `patch_size`. Results are provided per-chunk under the `chunks` directory.
* bins_gdf: Folder containing GeoPandas dataframes representing the 2um Visium HD bins within a given patch
* cells_gdf: Folder containing GeoPandas dataframes representing cells segmented in the tissue
* <bin_to_cell_method>/bin_to_cell_assign: Folder contains dataframes with the transcripts assigned to each cells

* <bin_to_cell_method>/<cell_annotation_method>_results/cells_adata.csv: Anndata object containing the results from ENACT (cell coordinates, cell types, transcript counts)
* <bin_to_cell_method>/<cell_annotation_method>_results/merged_results.csv: Dataframe (.csv) containing the results from ENACT (cell coordinates, cell types)
